_Authors_: Simone Vaccari, Alessio De Luca, Davide Vettore

**SmartScan AI** is an advanced machine learning tool capable of identifying lumps and categorizing them as either cancerous or non-cancerous.  \
Our primary **goal** is to provide oncologists with an exceptionally precise tool to fasten and enhance diagnoses, both crucial elements for improved early detection.

> Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the breast. It can occur in both men and women, but it's much more common in women.  \
